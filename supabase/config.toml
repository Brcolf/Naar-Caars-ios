# Supabase project config (used by CLI for local dev and deploy).
# See: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/function-configuration

# Push notification functions are invoked only by Database Webhooks.
# Webhooks often do not pass the Authorization header when type is "Supabase Edge Functions",
# causing 401 before the function runs. Disabling JWT verification here lets the webhook invoke
# the function; the function uses SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY for DB access and does not rely
# on the incoming JWT. The function URL is not secret; abuse is limited to triggering
# queue processing or sending with a valid payload shape.
