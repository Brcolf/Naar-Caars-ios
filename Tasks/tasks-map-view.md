# Tasks: Map View

Based on `prd-map-view.md`

## Relevant Files

### Source Files
- `Core/Services/LocationService.swift` - Extend with user location
- `Features/Rides/Views/RideMapView.swift` - Map display
- `UI/Components/Maps/RequestAnnotation.swift` - Map pin

### Test Files
- `NaarsCarsTests/Core/Services/LocationServiceTests.swift`

## Notes

- Uses MapKit for native iOS maps
- Requires location permission
- 🧪 items are QA tasks | 🔒 CHECKPOINT items are mandatory gates

## Instructions for Completing Tasks

**IMPORTANT:** As you complete each task, you must check it off in this markdown file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`. This helps track progress and ensures you don't skip any steps.

**BLOCKING:** Tasks marked with ⛔ block other features and must be completed first.

**QA RULES:**
1. Complete 🧪 QA tasks immediately after their related implementation
2. Do NOT skip past 🔒 CHECKPOINT markers until tests pass
3. Run: `./QA/Scripts/checkpoint.sh <checkpoint-id>` at each checkpoint
4. If checkpoint fails, fix issues before continuing

Example:
- `- [ ] 1.1 Read file` → `- [x] 1.1 Read file` (after completing)

Update the file after completing each sub-task, not just after completing an entire parent task.
