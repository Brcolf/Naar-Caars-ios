- 🧪 items are QA tasks | 🔒 CHECKPOINT items are mandatory gates

## Instructions for Completing Tasks

**IMPORTANT:** As you complete each task, you must check it off in this markdown file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`. This helps track progress and ensures you don't skip any steps.

**BLOCKING:** Tasks marked with ⛔ block other features and must be completed first.

**QA RULES:**
1. Complete 🧪 QA tasks immediately after their related implementation
2. Do NOT skip past 🔒 CHECKPOINT markers until tests pass
3. Run: `./QA/Scripts/checkpoint.sh <checkpoint-id>` at each checkpoint
4. If checkpoint fails, fix issues before continuing

Example:
- `- [ ] 1.1 Read file` → `- [x] 1.1 Read file` (after completing)

Update the file after completing each sub-task, not just after completing an entire parent task.
