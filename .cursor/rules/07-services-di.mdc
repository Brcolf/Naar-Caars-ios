description: "Reduce singleton coupling: ViewModels code to protocols, defaults may be shared singletons."

Applies to:
- /**/Service*/**
- /**/ViewModel*/**

Rules:
1) New ViewModels must depend on protocols (e.g., MessageServicing) rather than concrete singletons.
2) Existing ViewModels may keep .shared temporarily, but when touched:
   - prefer adding protocol + initializer injection
   - keep default init that wires .shared so call sites don't explode

3) No new cross-domain service dependencies without an explicit reason:
   - if Messaging needs Claiming, route through a narrow interface, not direct service fan-in.
