description: "Before changing high-blast-radius seams, require impact analysis and paired updates."

Applies to:
- /**

When modifying any of these seams:
- BadgeCountManager
- RealtimeManager
- NavigationCoordinator
- NotificationType / AppNotification
- SyncEngines (MessagingSyncEngine, DashboardSyncEngine, TownHallSyncEngine)
- SwiftData↔Domain mappers (MessagingMapper etc.)
- Supabase RPC call sites (e.g., get_badge_counts, get_conversations_with_details)
- NSNotification.Name constants/events
- Constants.swift

You MUST:
1) List upstream/downstream dependencies (modules/services/viewmodels) impacted.
2) Identify the contract(s) involved (payload shape, enum cases, RPC signature, model fields).
3) Update all consumers in the same change set (no partial updates).
4) End response with an "Impact Summary":
   - what changed
   - what files were updated
   - what would have broken if missed
