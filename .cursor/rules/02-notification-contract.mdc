description: "NotificationType registry must remain consistent across Swift + SQL + Edge Functions."

Applies to:
- /supabase/**
- /**/Notifications*/**
- /**/NotificationService*/**
- /**/Push*/**
- /**/BadgeCount*/**
- /**/AppNotification*/**

Rules:
1) Adding/removing/changing a notification type requires updating ALL of:
   - Swift enum / model
   - SQL triggers / RPCs / functions that emit the type
   - Edge function handlers that interpret or send it
   - Preferences mapping (if present)
   - Badge logic + routing logic

2) Do not introduce new notification type strings in-line.
   - Use a single registry source (e.g., notification_types.json) once established.
   - Until registry exists, define constants in one Swift file and one SQL file and reference them.

3) Must add/maintain tests/fixtures:
   - a fixture for at least one example payload per notification type family
   - a decoding test that ensures the client can parse the payload
