description: "Domain model field changes must be mirrored in SwiftData models and mappers."

Applies to:
- /**/SwiftData*/**
- /**/SDModel*/**
- /**/Mapper*/**
- /**/Repository*/**
- /**/SyncEngine*/**

Rules:
1) If you change a Domain model (Message/Ride/Favor/Conversation/Notification/TownHall entities):
   - update SwiftData model
   - update mapper(s)
   - update sync engine insert/update logic
   - add a mapper unit test or fixture

2) Do not pass SwiftData model instances across contexts/threads.
   - pass IDs and refetch in the correct context.

3) Persistence writes happen in repositories/sync engines, not in Views.
