description: "Realtime/webhook payload parsing must be centralized and unit tested."

Applies to:
- /**/Realtime*/**
- /**/SyncEngine*/**
- /**/MessagingSyncEngine*/**
- /**/DashboardSyncEngine*/**
- /supabase/functions/**

Rules:
1) ViewModels and SyncEngines must not hand-parse raw Any/JSON.
   - All payloads must go through a single adapter/decoder layer.

2) Adapter must normalize known shapes:
   - record/new
   - data.record/data.new
   - oldRecord/old
   - insert/update/delete variants

3) Every new or modified payload shape requires:
   - a JSON fixture
   - a unit test for normalization + decoding
