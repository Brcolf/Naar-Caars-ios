description: "NavigationCoordinator changes require a unified intent approach and routing validation."

Applies to:
- /**/Navigation*/**
- /**/Notifications*/**
- /**/AppDelegate*/**

Rules:
1) Avoid adding new @Published navigation flags (navigateToX).
   - Prefer a single NavigationIntent enum once established.

2) Any change to deep link / notification tap routing must include:
   - a routing table update (where each notification type maps to an intent)
   - a basic test or debug harness validating that mapping

3) If deferred navigation exists:
   - keep it behind a single mechanism (pendingIntent) and do not duplicate patterns.
