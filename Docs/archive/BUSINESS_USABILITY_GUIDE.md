# Naars Cars - Business & Usability Guide
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 23, 2026

## 🚗 What is Naars Cars?
Naars Cars is an **invite-only community platform** designed for neighbors and trusted circles to coordinate rides and favors. Unlike public ride-sharing, it relies on community trust, gift-based compensation, and mutual aid rather than commercial transactions.

## 📱 User Manual & Core Workflows

### 1. Getting Started (Onboarding)
*   **Invite Codes:** You must have a valid 8-character invite code to sign up. These are provided by existing members.
*   **Approval Process:** Upon signing up, your account enters a **Pending Approval** state. An administrator must verify your identity before you can access the community dashboard.
*   **Biometrics:** You can enable FaceID or TouchID in Settings for faster, secure access to the app.

### 2. The Dashboard (Rides & Favors)
*   **Requests Tab:** This is your primary feed. You can toggle between **Rides** (transportation) and **Favors** (errands, borrowing tools, etc.).
*   **Creating a Request:** Tap the `+` button. 
    *   **Rides:** Enter pickup/destination, date, time, and seats needed.
    *   **Favors:** Enter a descriptive title and the location.
*   **Gifts & Compensation:** Use the "Gift" field to specify how you'll show appreciation (e.g., "Coffee on me," "Gas money," or "Homemade cookies").

### 3. Claiming & Coordination
*   **Claiming a Request:** If you see a request you can fulfill, tap **Claim**.
*   **Private Messaging:** Claiming a request automatically creates a private group chat between the requester and the fulfiller. Use this to coordinate exact timing and details.
*   **Phone Visibility:** For safety, your phone number is hidden from the general community and only becomes visible to users you are actively coordinating a ride or favor with.

### 4. Completion & Reviews
*   **Marking Complete:** Once the task is finished, the **Requester** should tap "Mark Complete" in the request details.
*   **Reviews:** After completion, both parties are prompted to leave a rating and a brief review. This builds the "Trust Score" visible on public profiles.

### 5. Community (Town Hall)
*   **Public Posts:** Use the Town Hall tab to post general announcements or questions to the entire community.
*   **Reactions:** You can react to any message or post by long-pressing the bubble and selecting an emoji.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Why do I see "Unknown" as a username?
This usually occurs during a slow network refresh. **Pull down to refresh** the list, which will force the app to re-fetch the latest profile data from the server.

### My notification badge won't go away!
If the red dot persists on the Messages tab:
1. Open the specific conversation.
2. Ensure you scroll to the very bottom.
3. If it still persists, send a brief message to "kick" the read-receipt sync.

### How do I change my profile photo?
Go to the **Profile** tab, tap **Edit**, and then tap **Change Photo**. Note: The app requires "Limited" or "Full" photo library permissions to upload an image.

### The Map location is slightly off.
Apple Maps sometimes resolves addresses to the center of a block. For exact house numbers, use the **"Hold to Copy"** feature on the address in the Ride Details page and paste it directly into your GPS app.
