# iMessage Reaction Sticker Parity

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Status:** Approved
**Goal:** Unify the reaction system to match iMessage iOS 18 — per-person sticker badges, curated picker with extended emoji support, inline reaction details, and custom HAHA artwork.

---

## Context

The current reaction system has several inconsistencies with iMessage:

1. **Two rendering systems coexist** — 6 core reactions render as SF Symbol images via `TapbackGlyph`, while 15 extended reactions render as emoji text labels. At the same 22pt point size, these produce visually different sizes in the picker.
2. **Aggregated capsule badges** — reactions display as aggregated pills with counts (e.g., "❤️ 3") instead of per-person sticker badges with speech-bubble shapes.
3. **Selected state** — picker uses blue tint at 0.25 alpha + 1.15x scale transform, which breaks the uniform button grid. iMessage uses a solid blue filled circle at consistent size.
4. **Reaction set is defined in 3 places** — `MessageReaction.swift`, `ReactionBarView.swift`, and `TapbackGlyph.swift` with no single source of truth.
5. **Reaction details** — shown in a separate SwiftUI sheet, not inline in the overlay like iMessage.
6. **Fixed reaction set** — users are limited to 21 hardcoded reactions instead of being able to use any emoji.

### Approach

**Approach C: Rebuild badge, refactor picker, extend overlay.**

- **Rebuild** the badge view (per-person stickers are a fundamentally different data model than aggregated capsules)
- **Refactor** the picker bar (incremental: trim standard set, add recents + emoji button, fix selected state)
- **Extend** the overlay controller (add inline reaction details row)
- **Replace** the reaction details sheet with inline overlay details
- **Simplify** TapbackGlyph to HAHA-only custom artwork
- **Update** the reaction model to allow any emoji

The service layer, realtime sync, database schema, and optimistic update flow remain untouched. The ViewModel and `Message` model require minor additions to expose individual reaction records for per-person badge rendering.

---

## Section 1: Reaction Model Changes

### Files
- `NaarsCars/Core/Models/MessageReaction.swift`
- `NaarsCars/Core/Models/Message.swift`
- `NaarsCars/Core/Services/MessageReactionService.swift`

### Changes

**MessageReaction.swift:**
- Remove `quickReactions`, `extendedReactions`, `validReactions` static arrays
- Remove the `isValid` computed property
- Add a single `standardTapbacks` static array containing the 6 iMessage reactions: `["❤️", "👍", "👎", "😂", "‼️", "❓"]`
  - Note: `😂` is stored as the emoji but rendered as custom "HA HA" artwork in the UI layer. The model stores the emoji; the view layer handles the custom rendering.
- Any emoji string is now a valid reaction (no validation constraint)

**Message.swift:**
- Add a new optional property: `var individualReactions: [MessageReaction]?` alongside the existing `reactions: MessageReactions?`
- This stores the raw per-user reaction records needed by the sticker badge view
- The existing `MessageReactions` aggregated struct remains for ViewModel-level logic (counts, sorting)

**MessageReactionService.swift:**
- Remove the validation check against `validReactions` in `addReaction()` — accept any emoji string
- Add a new method `fetchIndividualReactions(messageId:) -> [MessageReaction]` that returns the raw decoded records (the existing `fetchReactions` already decodes them internally before aggregating — extract and expose this step)
- All other service logic (upsert, delete, fetch, participant check) remains unchanged

**Database:**
- No schema changes. The `message_reactions` table already uses `TEXT` with no `CHECK` constraint — validation was purely at the application layer.

---

## Section 2: Picker Bar (ReactionBarView Refactor)

### File
- `NaarsCars/UI/Components/Messaging/Overlay/ReactionBarView.swift`

### Changes

**Layout:**
- Keep the scrollable horizontal `UIStackView` inside `UIScrollView` with blur background
- First 6 items: the standard tapbacks from `MessageReaction.standardTapbacks`
  - ❤️, 👍, 👎 — rendered as emoji (UIButton title)
  - HAHA — rendered using `TapbackArtwork` custom view (not 😂 emoji, not SF Symbol)
  - ‼️, ❓ — rendered as emoji (UIButton title)
- After the 6: recently used emoji (tracked per-user, persisted via `UserDefaults`)
- Thin vertical divider (1pt, white at 0.2 alpha) between reaction items and the emoji keyboard button
- Emoji keyboard button at the end: smiley face icon in a circle with `rgba(255,255,255,0.12)` background — tapping it presents the system emoji keyboard

**Selected state:**
- Solid `UIColor.systemBlue` background (no alpha) on the button's `layer.backgroundColor`
- No scale transform — button stays at the existing `buttonSize` (40pt × 40pt)
- Remove `CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 1.15, y: 1.15)`

**Single source of truth:**
- Remove the duplicated `allReactions` Unicode escape array
- Reference `MessageReaction.standardTapbacks` for the 6 standard reactions
- Recent emoji managed separately via a local `RecentReactionsStore` (UserDefaults-backed, stores last ~15 used emoji)

**Emoji keyboard integration:**
- Use a hidden `UITextField` with `becomeFirstResponder()` to present the system emoji keyboard
- On emoji input, fire `onReact` callback and dismiss the keyboard
- Restrict input to emoji-only (validate via `Character.isActualEmoji` from `EmojiDetection.swift`)

## Section 3: Sticker Badge (New ReactionStickerBadgeView)

### Files
- **New:** `NaarsCars/UI/Components/Messaging/Cells/ReactionStickerBadgeView.swift`
- **Delete:** `NaarsCars/UI/Components/Messaging/Cells/ReactionBadgeView.swift`

### Design

**Per-person stickers (not aggregated capsules):**
- Each reaction record (from `MessageReaction`) gets its own sticker view
- Sticker shape: rounded rect with asymmetric corner radii — three large corners + one small corner (bottom-leading) to create the speech-bubble tail effect
  - Approximate: `UIBezierPath` with `cornerRadius: 14` on top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and `cornerRadius: 4` on bottom-left
- Size: ~28-30pt diameter
- Content: emoji rendered as text, except HAHA which uses `TapbackArtwork`

**Color coding:**
- Current user's reaction: `UIColor.systemBlue` background
- Other users' reactions: `UIColor.systemGray` at ~0.6 alpha (dark mode) / `UIColor.systemGray5` (light mode)

**Layout:**
- Overlapping z-order: newest (rightmost) sticker on top, ~8pt horizontal overlap
- `layer.zPosition` increases left to right (newest = highest)
- Positioned at top-trailing corner of the message bubble (same anchor as current)
- X: `primary.frame.maxX - badgeWidth - 4` for received, `primary.frame.minX + 4` for sent
- Y: `primary.frame.minY - badgeHeight * 0.6` (60% above top edge)

**Truncation (4+ unique reaction types):**
- Show max 3 unique reaction-type stickers in compact mode
- All rendered in gray (no blue distinction in truncated mode)
- Each shows the emoji only (no avatar context)
- Tapping truncated badges opens the overlay with full reaction details

**Data hydration:**
- Badge receives `[MessageReaction]` (individual records with userId) instead of `MessageReactions` (aggregated dictionary)
- `ConversationDetailViewModel` exposes the individual records via a new computed property or by keeping them alongside the aggregated data
- Badge uses `currentUserId` to determine blue/gray coloring

**Interaction:**
- Tap: opens the `MessageOverlayController` with reaction details pre-populated
- No long-press behavior needed on the badge itself

## Section 4: Inline Reaction Details (Replaces ReactionDetailsSheet)

### Files
- **New:** `NaarsCars/UI/Components/Messaging/Overlay/ReactionDetailsRowView.swift`
- **Delete:** `NaarsCars/Features/Messaging/Views/ReactionDetailsSheet.swift`
- **Modified:** `NaarsCars/UI/Components/Messaging/Overlay/MessageOverlayController.swift`
- **Modified:** `NaarsCars/Features/Messaging/Views/ConversationDetailView.swift`

### Design

**ReactionDetailsRowView:**
- Horizontal scrollable `UIScrollView` containing a `UIStackView`
- Each item is a vertical stack:
  - Large sticker (~48-52pt) in speech-bubble shape with gray background
  - User avatar/initials circle (~24pt) below the sticker
- If multiple users reacted with the same emoji, their avatars overlap below that single sticker
- Styled with dark blur background (`systemUltraThinMaterial`), rounded corners (16pt)

**Integration with MessageOverlayController:**
- Details row is positioned above the message snapshot, below the picker bar
- Layout order top-to-bottom: picker bar → details row → message snapshot → action list
- Details row is shown when:
  1. User taps on reaction badges on a message (overlay opens with details visible)
  2. User long-presses a message that already has reactions (details visible by default)
- Details row is hidden when the message has no reactions
- Requires `[MessageReaction]` individual records and profile data (avatar URLs, display names) for the avatar circles

**Profile data for avatars:**
- The existing `ConversationDetailView.refreshReactionProfiles(for:)` method fetches `Profile` objects for reactors — this logic moves into `ConversationDetailViewModel` as a new method
- Profile data is passed through to `MessageOverlayController` when presenting, which forwards it to `ReactionDetailsRowView`

**ConversationDetailView.swift cleanup:**
- Remove `@State private var showReactionDetails: Bool`
- Remove `@State private var reactionDetailsMessage: Message?`
- Remove `@State private var reactionProfiles: [String: [Profile]]`
- Remove the `.sheet(isPresented: $showReactionDetails)` modifier that presents `ReactionDetailsSheet`
- Remove the `reactionDetailsContent` computed property
- Remove the `refreshReactionProfiles(for:)` method
- Remove the `"__details__"` sentinel handling in `onReactionTap` — badge taps now go directly through the overlay flow

**Remove own reaction:**
- User can tap their own reaction sticker in the details row to remove it
- Fires the existing `onRemoveReaction` callback through the overlay

**Animation:**
- Details row fades in with the same entrance animation as the picker bar (0.3s, damping 0.85)
- Slides in from the same direction as the picker bar (±10pt offset)

## Section 5: TapbackGlyph → TapbackArtwork

### File
- `NaarsCars/UI/Components/Messaging/TapbackGlyph.swift` → rename to `TapbackArtwork.swift`

### Changes

- Remove the 6-entry mapping array
- Remove SF Symbol rendering for ❤️, 👍, 👎, ‼️, ❓
- Single purpose: render the custom "HA HA" artwork for the laugh tapback
- API: `static func hahaImage(pointSize: CGFloat) -> UIImage`
  - Renders "HA HA" text in a stacked layout with bold weight and blue color (`UIColor.systemBlue`)
  - Uses `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` to produce a rasterized image at the requested point size
- Also provide: `static func isHaha(_ reaction: String) -> Bool` — checks if a reaction string matches the 😂 emoji (which should be rendered as HAHA)
- Update `NaarsCars/NaarsCarsTests/Features/Messaging/TapbackGlyphTests.swift` to match the new API (rename to `TapbackArtworkTests.swift`)

---

## Section 6: Wiring Changes

### MessageCellView.swift
- Replace `reactionBadge: ReactionBadgeView?` with `reactionStickerBadge: ReactionStickerBadgeView?`
- Pass individual `[MessageReaction]` records and `currentUserId` to the badge instead of aggregated `MessageReactions`
- Badge tap opens the overlay with details (new delegate method or callback)

### MessagesViewController.swift
- Handle the new badge-tap entry point: present `MessageOverlayController` with `showDetails: true` flag
- Remove any references to `ReactionDetailsSheet` presentation
- The `onReactionTap` callback in `MessagesViewController.Configuration` may need signature changes or the `"__details__"` sentinel pattern may become obsolete — badge taps now go through the overlay directly

### MessagesViewControllerRepresentable.swift
- Update the `onReactionTap` callback wiring to match any signature changes in `MessagesViewController.Configuration`

### ConversationDetailViewModel.swift
- Expose individual `MessageReaction` records per message (not just aggregated `MessageReactions`)
- The service already decodes individual records internally — use the new `fetchIndividualReactions` method and store results on `Message.individualReactions`
- Move the `refreshReactionProfiles(for:)` logic from `ConversationDetailView` into the ViewModel so profile data is available for the overlay's inline details row

### ConversationDetailView.swift
- Remove all `ReactionDetailsSheet`-related state, modifiers, and methods (see Section 4 for full list)

### MessageOverlayController.swift
- Add `ReactionDetailsRowView` as a subview
- Accept a `showDetails: Bool` flag to control whether details are visible on entry
- Update layout constraints to accommodate the details row between picker and snapshot
- Pass reaction data and current user ID to the details row

---

## Untouched Components

These components require **no changes**:
- Database schema (`message_reactions` table)
- `MessagingSyncEngine` (realtime subscription)
- `MessageSendManager` (optimistic update flow)
- `MessageReactions` struct (aggregated model still used by ViewModel)
- All message bubble views (TextBubbleView, ImageBubbleView, etc.)
- Audio, location, link preview components
- Reply/threading system
- Read receipts

**Implicitly affected (no direct changes needed):**
- `MessageThreadViewController.swift` — reuses `MessageCellView` via `ThreadMessageCell`, so the badge swap propagates automatically. The badge-tap-to-overlay flow should be verified in thread context.
- `MessagesCollectionView.swift` — defines `MessageContentCell` hosting `MessageCellView`, implicitly affected by the property rename.
- `project.pbxproj` — file deletions, additions, and the `TapbackGlyph` → `TapbackArtwork` rename require Xcode project file updates.

### Deprecation note
- The new `ReactionStickerBadgeView` should use the modern `UITraitChangeObservable` registration API instead of `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)`, which is deprecated in iOS 17+.
