# Naars Cars Privacy Policy
**Effective date:** January 20, 2026  
**Last updated:** January 20, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **Naars Cars** (the “App”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use the Naars Cars iOS application and related services (collectively, the “Services”).

## 1. Who we are / Contact
The Services are operated by **Brendan Colford** (“Naars Cars,” “we,” “us,” “our”).

- **Email:** naarscars@gmail.com
- **Mailing address:** (optional) [Add mailing address if you want one published]
- **Website:** (optional) [Add website URL]

## 2. Scope
This Privacy Policy applies to the Services and covers information collected:

- Through the iOS app
- Through push notifications and in-app notifications
- Through our backend infrastructure used to operate the Services

## 3. Summary (plain English)
Naars Cars is an invite-only community app where members can:

- Create and claim **ride requests** and **favor requests**
- Message other members (including sharing images)
- Post in the **Town Hall** (including images)
- Leave **reviews** (optionally with images)

We collect information you provide (like your name, email, phone number, posts, and messages) to run these features. We also collect limited technical data (like push notification tokens and optional crash reports) to operate and improve the app. We do **not** sell your personal information and we do **not** use your data for cross-app tracking advertising.

## 4. Information we collect
### 4.1 Information you provide
Depending on how you use the Services, we may collect:

- **Account information**: email address and authentication identifiers (via Supabase Auth; may include “Sign in with Apple”).
- **Profile information**: name, optional car description, optional phone number, optional profile photo (avatar).
- **User content**:
  - Ride requests and favor requests you create
  - Messages you send (including attachments such as images)
  - Town Hall posts and comments you create (including images)
  - Reviews and ratings you submit (optionally with images)
- **Community guidelines acceptance**: whether you accepted the guidelines and the time of acceptance.
- **Subscription information (if you purchase a subscription):**
  - Purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not receive your full payment card details.
  - Apple may provide us limited information needed to operate your subscription status (for example, whether you have an active subscription).

### 4.2 Information collected automatically
We may collect:

- **Push notification token and device identifier**: used to deliver push notifications to your device. We store a token plus a per-device identifier and link it to your user account.
- **Diagnostics / crash data (optional)**: if you enable “Share Crash Reports,” we collect crash logs and related diagnostics through **Firebase Crashlytics**. We may also associate crash reports with your app user ID (a UUID) to help us troubleshoot account-specific issues.

### 4.3 Location information
If you grant location permission:

- The app may access **precise location while the app is in use** to support map-related features (e.g., showing nearby requests).
- We do **not** intend to store your precise location on our servers for long-term tracking; location may be used transiently to display map results.

Separately, the app supports **address/location autocomplete** using Apple’s MapKit search services. Your typed search queries may be sent to Apple to return suggestions.

### 4.4 Photos and camera
If you choose to upload images, we may access:

- **Photo library** (to choose an avatar or attach images to messages/posts/reviews)
- **Camera** (if you choose to take a photo)

## 5. How we use information
We use information to:

- **Provide core app functionality**, including accounts, profiles, ride/favor requests, messaging, reviews, and Town Hall posts
- **Facilitate community coordination**, including displaying relevant profile details to other members (for example, your name and, if you provide it, your phone number for coordination)
- **Send notifications** (push notifications via Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and in-app notifications)
- **Maintain safety and integrity**, including enforcing community guidelines and preventing abuse
- **Operate, troubleshoot, and improve** the Services (including optional crash reporting, debugging, and performance monitoring)

## 6. How information is shared
We share information in limited circumstances:

### 6.1 With other users (community sharing)
The Services are social by design. Depending on features you use, other members may be able to view:

- Your profile information you choose to provide (such as name, car, avatar, and **phone number (visible to all members)** if you provide it)
- Your ride/favor requests
- Your Town Hall posts
- Your reviews and ratings
- Your messages and message images with recipients/participants

### 6.2 Service providers / processors
We use third-party providers to operate the Services:

- **Supabase** (backend): authentication, database, realtime features, and file storage.
- **Apple**: APNs for push notification delivery and MapKit services for map/autocomplete functionality.
- **Firebase Crashlytics** (Google): diagnostics and crash reporting (only if enabled in-app).

These providers process information on our behalf under their terms and policies.

### 6.3 Legal and safety disclosures
We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:

- Comply with law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request
- Enforce our Terms of Service and community guidelines
- Protect the rights, property, and safety of Naars Cars, our users, or the public

### 6.4 Business transfers
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction, consistent with law.

## 7. Public URLs and shared images (important)
Some uploaded images may be stored in a way that allows access via a URL. If you share an image in a message/post/review, anyone with access to the content (or the URL) may be able to view it. Please do not upload sensitive content you don’t want shared.

## 8. Data retention
We retain information for as long as needed to provide the Services and for legitimate business purposes (such as security, fraud prevention, and dispute resolution), unless a longer retention period is required by law.

In general:

- **Account/profile data** is retained until you delete your account.
- **User content** (requests, posts, messages, reviews) is retained until you delete your account or until it is removed by you or by moderation/admin actions, subject to backups and legal requirements.
- **Push tokens** are retained until you remove them (e.g., logout / token refresh) or delete your account.
- **Crash reporting data** (if enabled) is retained according to Firebase Crashlytics retention settings and may persist for a limited period after you disable crash reporting or delete your account.

## 9. Account deletion
You can delete your account in the app (currently via **My Profile → Delete Account**). Account deletion is intended to remove your profile and associated data from our database, including items such as:

- Push tokens
- Notifications
- Reviews (given/received)
- Town Hall posts
- Invite codes you created
- Messages you sent
- Conversations you created or participated in
- Ride and favor requests you created
- Request Q&A items you created

> Some information may remain in backups for a limited period, or be retained as required by law.

If you used **Sign in with Apple**, we take steps to revoke/unlink Apple sign-in credentials as part of account deletion, as required by Apple’s policies.

## 10. Your choices and controls
### 10.1 Crash reporting
You can opt out of crash reporting via **Settings → Privacy → Share Crash Reports**.

### 10.2 Push notifications
You can enable or disable push notifications via iOS Settings and within the app’s notification preferences.

### 10.3 Location
You can enable or disable location access in iOS Settings. The app should still function with location disabled, though some map-related features may be limited.

### 10.4 Access, correction, and deletion
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete personal information. To request help with these, contact us at **naarscars@gmail.com**.

## 11. Children’s privacy
The Services are intended for adults and are **not directed to children**. If you believe a minor has provided us personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

## 12. International users
If you use the Services outside the United States, your information may be processed in countries where we and our service providers operate.

## 13. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect information, including using encryption in transit where supported by our providers and restricting access to systems. However, no system is perfectly secure.

## 14. Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date and, if changes are material, provide additional notice as required by law.
